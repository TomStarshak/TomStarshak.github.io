title: Coursera Reinforcement Learning Specialization
---

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) is one of the original MOOCs. This Summer I learned they were offering a [reinforcement learning course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)
taught by the University of Alberta and following [Sutton and Barto](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf) (Warning, pdf)

As this is a topic of machine learning I haven't gotten into a ton, I was very interested. Currently I've finished the second course in the 
specialization. It's fine, but I feel the assignments are much more of toy problems than, say, the [deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?) specialization.
Also, looking into the textbook, the course skips over Monte Carlo Tree Search which I was looking forward to due to the success of AlphaGo.

Overall I'm enjoying my time, but I think afterwards I'll be wanting a deeper dive into the material. Which, I guess, is what you should expect from a MOOC.
