Hopefully this site will eventually be a blog concerning thoughts and projects about machine learning, analytics, tech, books, and anything else I think is appropriate.

Like a lot of people I came to be interested in ML after seeing an article hyping the field, I think it was about the Netflix recommendation competition. I think did a decent amount of MOOCs (Coursera, edX  and Udacity). 
Eventually I also finished an MS (Georgia Tech), read papers, listened to podcasts, etc. This site started on a whim during the 2020 Covid-19 outbreak, so if it doesn't get updated hopefully it's because I lost interest and not the other reason.


Thanks for reading!
