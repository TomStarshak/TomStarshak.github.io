Hopefully this site will eventually be a blog concerning thoughts and projects on machine learning, analytics, tech, books, and anything else I think is appropriate.

Like a lot of people I came to be interested in ML after seeing an article hyping the field, probably about the Netflix recommendation competition. I did a decent amount of MOOCs (Coursera, edX  and Udacity) and also
finished an MS (Georgia Tech). This site started on a whim during the 2020 Covid-19 outbreak, so if it doesn't get updated hopefully it's because I lost interest and not the other reason.


Thanks for reading!
